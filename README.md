## Original Scrimba courses

At Scrimba our goal is to create the best possible coding school at the cost of a gym membership! ðŸ’œ
If we succeed with this, it will give anyone who wants to become a software developer a realistic shot at succeeding, regardless of where they live and the size of their wallets ðŸŽ‰
The Frontend Developer Career Path aims to teach you everything you need to become a Junior Developer, or you could take a deep-dive with one of our advanced courses ðŸš€

## Modification to be applied on supabase
Insert the following SQL code on your supabase database. This will create a table to store your documents and a function to search for documents.

```sql
-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
create extension vector;

-- Create a table to store your documents
create table documents (
  id bigserial primary key,
  content text, -- corresponds to Document.pageContent
  metadata jsonb, -- corresponds to Document.metadata
  embedding vector(1536) -- 1536 works for OpenAI embeddings, change if needed
);

-- Create a function to search for documents
create function match_documents (
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_count int DEFAULT null,
  filter jsonb DEFAULT '{}'
) returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  embedding jsonb,
  similarity float
)
language plpgsql
as $$
#variable_conflict use_column
begin
  return query
  select
    id,
    content,
    metadata,
    (embedding::text)::jsonb as embedding,
    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  from documents
  where metadata @> filter
  order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;
```

## TODO
Prepare the document text then generate embeddings
- [ ] Prepare the document text
- [ ] Python script to insert the data
